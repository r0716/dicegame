This project is a JavaScript-based dice game where two players take turns rolling dice. The goal of the game is to reach a higher dice score before your opponent does.

Features
Random dice rolls: The game uses JavaScript's Math.random() function to generate random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating dice rolls.
Turn-based gameplay: Players take turns rolling the dice and accumulating points. They can choose to roll again or hold their current score.
